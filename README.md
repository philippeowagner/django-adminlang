django-adminlang
================

Keep control of Django admin site's language.
-- 

The idea behind django-adminlang is to keep language consistance in the admin site. This allows to display the Django admin site in a predefined language (for example in English), even if the superuser was browsing (for example in German) through the website. This avoids to display a multilingual mix due to missing or broken translations of reusable apps and other third party components.
